## Sample Project

### Database Setup

Running the sample project requires creating a new Xperience by Kentico database using the included template.

Change directory in your console to `./examples/DancingGoat` and follow the instructions in the Xperience
documentation on [creating a new database](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/installation#Installation-CreateProjectDatabase).

## FrontEnd Customization

The Aira Unified application uses frontend assets located in:

- `src/Kentico.Xperience.AiraUnified/wwwroot/js/index.js`
- `src/Kentico.Xperience.AiraUnified/wwwroot/css/`

These files are **generated** from source files located in the `src/Kentico.Xperience.AiraUnified/FrontEnd` folder.

Changes made to the client-side code in the `FrontEnd` folder will **not** be reflected immediately. To apply the changes, you must rebuild the assets using Webpack.

### Rebuilding Client Assets

After making changes, navigate to the `FrontEnd` folder and run the following commands:

```bash
npm run build
npm run build-css
```

This will recompile the JavaScript and CSS, and update the files in the wwwroot directory accordingly.

## Development Workflow

1. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a new branch with one of the following prefixes:
     - `feat/` - for new functionality
     - `refactor/` - for restructuring of existing features
     - `fix/` - for bugfixes
     - `docs/` - for documentation changes
     - `test/` - for test-related changes

2. **Code Formatting**
   - Run `dotnet format` against the `Kentico.Xperience.RepoTemplate` solution
   - Use `dotnet: format` VS Code task
   - Ensure consistent code style across the project

   > use `dotnet: format` VS Code task.

1. Commit changes, with a commit message preferably following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) convention.

1. Once ready, create a PR on GitHub. The PR will need to have all comments resolved and all tests passing before it will be merged.

   - The PR should have a helpful description of the scope of changes being contributed.
   - Include screenshots or video to reflect UX or UI updates
   - Indicate if new settings need to be applied when the changes are merged - locally or in other environments

## Asset Management

### JavaScript Versioning

When updating JavaScript files, it's important to update the version in the following locations:

1. In the `FrontEnd/package.json` file - update the `version` field
2. In the `Admin/AiraUnifiedConstants.cs` file - update the `AssetVersion` constant

These two values should always be synchronized to ensure proper loading of new file versions in browsers.

Example:
```json
// FrontEnd/package.json
{
  "version": "1.2.0",
  ...
}
```

```csharp
// Admin/AiraUnifiedConstants.cs
public const string AssetVersion = "1.2.0";
```

### External Dependencies

This project uses Bootstrap from CDN. If you need to use a local version of Bootstrap or a different version, you can modify the links in the `Views/Shared/_AiraLayout.cshtml` file.
